## EPA Http request parsing
A small demo on how to parse EPA log file. 

Database used is a simple SQLite3 DB.

#### Intentions
* For study and education only propose. 
* There is plenty of room to improvement, 
    * Use "glob" to fetch the logs,
    * Request "RQL" for filter the query made to the db,
    * RollUp jobs for faster queries once the DB gets bigger.

#### Disclaimer
* Free to use, no copyright and "delivered as is", no warranty. 
* I used [CanvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/jquery-charts/) as for the View demo.
